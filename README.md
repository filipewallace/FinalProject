# FinalProject

Skill Distillery Angular Final Project

### Description

This web application is about mods for video games. Through the website, users can view and search for various video games and any mods available for those games. The user can log in and then add a mod to a game, update information for the mod, and delete the mod. The user can also review (rate) a mod and post comments about mods. While logged in, users can select a mod to buy and add the mod to their own user library. Users can also sell a mod that they have added for a game. A logged in admin has additional privileges that a standard logged in user does not have.
